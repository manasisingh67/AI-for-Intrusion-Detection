# AI-Based Intrusion Detection System

## Overview

As technology advances, cyber threats are evolving, demanding innovative solutions for effective intrusion detection...

## Project Objectives

1. **Explore and implement AI techniques for adaptive intrusion detection.**
2. **Identify and employ AI models with superior outcomes.**
3. **Develop algorithms capable of analyzing both network traffic and server/system logs.**

## Approach & Methodology

### Approach

- Utilizes supervised machine learning techniques.
- Key performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- In-depth analysis using confusion matrices.

### Methodology

1. **Data Selection:**
   - Utilized CICIDS2017 for network traffic and CIDDS-001 for log analysis.
   - Maintained an intentionally unbalanced distribution to mimic real-world conditions.
   - Please note that the dataset is not uploaded on this repository. You can find it on Kaggle.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Employed Pandas for creating, cleaning, and preprocessing data frames.
   - Standardized data in CSV format.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Functions for splitting, scaling, encoding labels, and applying PCA.
   - Ensured modularity and consistency for both analyses.

## Data Visualization

- Explored label distributions and PCA 2D visualization for network traffic and log analysis.

## Training, Testing, and Optimization
